# Distilled XSum Dataset


This folder contains a dataset loading script to build a distilled XSum dataset using pseudo-labels.


This folder contains the dataset loading script for the distilled XSum data, which replaces the gold summaries with the [pseudo-labels](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/research_projects/seq2seq-distillation/precomputed_pseudo_labels.md) generated by google/pegasus-xsum.

## Usage
1. Download the pseudo-labels dataset.
    - `dpx_pl` is downloaded from [Saved Pseudo-Labels](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/research_projects/seq2seq-distillation/precomputed_pseudo_labels.md), which is generated by google/pegasus-xsum.
2. Load the data
    1. Directly load with the `datasets` library.
        ```python
        from datasets import load_dataset

        data = datasets.load_dataset("yuyang/distil_xsum", "1.0.0")
        ```
    2. Load the data with the data loading script locally. Note that after the following code is run once, we can then directly specify the `dataset_name` in the experiment configuration file to be "distil_xsum".
        ```python
        from datasets import load_dataset

        load_dataset("path/to/distil_xsum", "1.0.0")
        ```
